Full Stack Demo Project
=======================

Greetings, full-stack traveler.

This bundle includes a static HTML, browser-based app that searches
for upcoming Meetups using the Meetup API's [Open Events][events]
method. Open `index.html` in a web browser to try for yourself!

It also uses our locally-grown CSS framework, [Sassquatch][sassquatch].

Favorite Quest
--------------

The starter project is pretty good for finding Meetups, but its name
hints at broader aspirations. We'd like you to help *Meetup Faves*
live up to that name.

With the software stack of your choice, implement a feature to record
selected Meetups as the user's favorites. You may want to use empty
and filled (☆ ★) stars to indicate their status.

The favorite status should be persisted to a data store *outside* the
browser. Providing a favorites web API and toggling event statuses
with Ajax seems like a pretty good idea to us, but, it's your project.

Additionally, your users may want to list all their favorite Meetups
without having to find them through text search results. You could
treat "favorites" as a special kind of search, for example.

Whose favorites?
----------------

For this project you may assume that all users will have their own
application and data store instance, or that all users will be happy
to share the same set of favorites. Or you could use a stack's built
in user account management. It's really up to you! (We just want to
see your code.)

Turning in the test
-------------------

Your time is valuable -- so we'd like you to spend **no more than 3
hours** on this project. When you're at a good stopping point, zip it
up and e-mail it back along with a URL to where your test is running, 
or an easy way to provision it (vagrant, etc).

Thanks, and good luck!
